    <h2 class="white federant margin center">The iPad pro</h2>
    <p class="white federant indent">The iPad as a laptop alternative first became viable to sone niche users back in 2015 when the first ipad pro was released. the first ipad pro had a screen size of 12.9 inches. The main accessories for the iPad were released alongside it and they were the smart folio case & the smart cover. This was an important leap for ipads being used as computers mostly because the ipad didnt have a good way to connect a keyboard other than through bluetooth which was inconvenient. Later, in 2016 a 9.7 inch ipad pro was released which came with compatibility with apple pencil & its own form of smart keyboard. This brings me onto the next generation of ipad pro.</p>
    <h2 class="white federant margin center">The 2nd generation</h2>
    <p class="white federant indent">The second generation of iPad pro featured many improvements, some of which include: a 10.5 inch screen instead of a 9.7 inch screen, larger base & highest teir storage (64gb instead of 32gb, & 512gb instead of 256gb), promotion displays (120hz displays), better cameras, & a better cpu (A10x instead of A9x).  this was to become a minor update compared to the 3rd generation of ipad pro(12.9in).</p>
    <h2 class="white federant margin center">The 3rd generation</h2>
    <p class="white federant indent">the ipad pro 12.9 3rd gen was a huge update from the 2nd generation of ipad pro. this was because this ipad pro was to feature an edge to edge display while also using face id to unlock, no home button, and gestures to replace them. this model of ipad pro also had a really good camera as this was becomingmore important. this also introduced a really good a12x chip that was a great improvement over the previous ipad pro. this also replaced the 10.5 inch with a 11 inch variant. The 2020 ipad pro added lidar, a12z, a wide angle camera, and a new case that was backward compatable that added trackpad support. (trackpad also works with 2018 ipad pro)</p>
